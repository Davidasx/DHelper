### `DHelper`:A helper for Online Judges

#### Requirements

- Windows system

- g++ compiler
- [Competitive Companion](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion)

#### Notes

`parse2cf` comes from [here]().(I compiled it myself under Windows)

On its first run,Windows Firewall will ask whether you allow it or not.

Remember to allow it!

#### Installing

Clone this repository.

Then run:

```
cd dhelper
install
```

It will compile `dhelper` automatically!

Then,follow the instructions on the screen.

Remember to wait until the installer tells you to `Press any key to continue...`  !

Good luck and high rating!

#### Thanks

Idea is from [`caide`](https://github.com/slycelote/caide) and [`cf-tool`](https://github.com/xalanq/cf-tool).

Without [Competitive Companion](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion) and [`parse2cf`](),this project would be totally impossible.

#### Frequently Asked Questions

  A: Run in command line.
